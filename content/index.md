# About Me

This is a minimal website to host some of my projects and professional profile. 

I make very infrequent updates to the site as of now.

## Currently working as a Data Reporting and Analytics Consultant at Kaiser Permanente. I work with national provider data across all of the regions that KP operates. My role is cross functional with projects in analytics, web development, data engineering, process automation, and IT troubleshooting. I work with R/Python/SQL most of the day. I'm most excited by learning and building new things. I thrive with POC projects and getting new ideas off the ground.

## My background is environmental sciences / renewable energy / spatial data modeling. I most recently worked in energy efficiency consulting where I interacted with energy data with various tools.

## Outside of work I am a dad of two, which takes up much of my free time. I like to ride my bike through the city streets or the woods whenever I can.

## I hold a bachelor’s degree in natural resources from Oregon State University and a master’s degree in environmental sciences and management from Humboldt State University as well as a graduate certificate in GIS from Portland State University. My thesis was on the decomposition of course woody debris in relation to their use as biomass energy. I still find topics related to how we generate and distribute electricity extremely interesting.
