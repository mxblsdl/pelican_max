Title: Shiny Server

## Some years back I set up my own Shiny Server to develop and test out different Shiny applications and libraries. This was a passion project where I got to build the server from a basic base image and work through the setup and implementation of apps, databases, service workers, authentication, and web servers. Many of the apps never really get *finished*, but for me the creation and problem solving aspect is the most enjoyable part. I stopped maintaining the project a while back and have since scrapped the server. The repo for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/mxblsdl/shiny-server)

## I used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to set everything up as its far less complicated than AWS/GCP/Azure and I've found they have very clear tutorials for a host of issues. Creating and maintaining the server was a great learning experience in itself and showed me the power of what a minimal cloud server can do. I ran DO's lowest power option for $5 a month which was plenty for hosting Shiny Server andRStudio Server as well as a couple of databases.
