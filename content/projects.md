Title: Projects

## In grad school I took a GIS focused class on web mapping and became infatuated with Javascript and how the internet works. I spent some free time learning vanilla javascript and writing websites with HTML and CSS. These projects are created with plain HTML, CSS, and JS for a personal website that went largely unfinished. They are hosted through github and it never made sense to port them over to this site. These were just for fun when I discovered web development but I'm still happy with them years later.

### [NBA Chart JS](https://mxblsdl.github.io/urls/nba_stats.html){target='_blank'}

Interactive chart made with Chart JS and data processing/web scraping with R. Compares NBA players on a couple different stats.

### [NBA Map](https://mxblsdl.github.io/nba_fission/){target='_blank'}


Interactive map of NBA arenas made entirely with JS. Data processing with R

### [Radio Coverage](https://mxblsdl.github.io/urls/or_radio/){target='_blank'}

Recreation of a Carto DB map showing coverage for basketball radio stations in Oregon

### [Voting Power](https://mxblsdl.github.io/urls/voting_power.html){target = '_blank'}

Exercise in Chart JS, Leaflet, and a little D3 showing relative voting power of different states

### [CA Agriculture](https://mxblsdl.github.io/urls/ag.html){target='_blank'}

The beta interface to a biomass power study concerning agriculture in California. The details of the project can be hard to explain, but I think this is a nice use of Chart.js and leaflet to display data.    

This would eventually become the webtool seen [here](https://cbrec.schatzcenter.org/forest/forestry.html) although I was no longer working on the project when this was created.
